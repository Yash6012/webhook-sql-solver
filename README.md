Yash Singh

I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at VIT Bhopal University. I actively develop projects using Python, C++, Java, and IoT technologies. I work with tools like OpenCV, Raspberry Pi, and Power BI to build solutions in machine learning, computer vision, and automation. I have created a face recognition-based attendance system and an IoT-powered water tank automation project. I completed a winter internship at Indian Space Lab and earned certifications in cloud computing and networking.
